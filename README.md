# üöÄ AI-Powered Entropy Management System - Implementation Guide

## üéØ Overview

You now have a complete **AI-Powered Entropy Management System** prototype with three core workflows:

1. **üèóÔ∏è Business OS Builder** - Transforms business documents into systematic 0-9 structure
2. **üêô GitHub Structure Creator** - Deploys organized repositories with templates
3. **üîÑ Daily Entropy Management** - Automates daily organization and maintenance

## üìã Prerequisites (Already Completed ‚úÖ)

- ‚úÖ Docker Desktop 4.42.0+ with MCP support
- ‚úÖ n8n workflow engine running (localhost:5678)
- ‚úÖ Model Runner with AI models loaded (model-runner.docker.internal:12434)
- ‚úÖ Docker MCP Toolkit configured

## Getting Started


## üöÄ Implementation Steps

### Step 0. Bring up n8n + Model Runner + MCP Toolkit

```
git clone https://github.com/ajeetraina/n8n-model-runner
cd n8n-model-runner
docker compose up -d
```

Ensure that you follow [these steps beforehand](https://github.com/ajeetraina/n8n-model-runner/blob/main/README.md#step-3-project-setup).

### Step 1: Import the Workflows

**Import all three workflows into your n8n dashboard:**

1. **Business OS Builder**
   - Copy JSON from `simple-business-os-workflow` artifact
   - Import to n8n ‚Üí Save ‚Üí Activate
   - **Webhook URL**: `http://localhost:5678/webhook/build-business-os`

2. **GitHub Structure Creator**
   - Copy JSON from `github_structure_creator` artifact
   - Import to n8n ‚Üí Save ‚Üí Activate
   - **Webhook URL**: `http://localhost:5678/webhook/create-github-structure`

3. **Daily Entropy Management**
   - Copy JSON from `daily_entropy_management` artifact
   - Import to n8n ‚Üí Save ‚Üí Activate
   - **Webhook URL**: `http://localhost:5678/webhook/process-entropy`
   - **Auto-trigger**: Daily at 9 AM

### Step 2: Set Up GitHub MCP Integration

**Enable GitHub repository creation:**

```bash
# Set up GitHub Personal Access Token
docker mcp secret set GITHUB.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=github_pat_your_token_here

# Enable GitHub MCP server in Docker Desktop
# Go to Extensions ‚Üí MCP Toolkit ‚Üí Enable "GitHub Official"

# Restart Claude Desktop to pick up new MCP servers
```

### Step 3: Test the Business OS Builder

**Create test business documents:**

```bash
# Test the Business OS Builder
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5678/webhook/build-business-os" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "company_name": "Tech Startup Inc",
    "documents": [
      {
        "type": "mission_vision_values",
        "content": "Mission: Build amazing software that helps businesses grow. Vision: Become the leading platform for business automation. Values: Innovation, Customer Success, Team Collaboration."
      },
      {
        "type": "brand_guidelines", 
        "content": "Brand: Modern, professional, approachable. Colors: Blue (#2563eb), Gray (#64748b). Voice: Clear, helpful, expert but not condescending."
      },
      {
        "type": "resource_inventory",
        "content": "Team: 5 engineers, 2 designers, 1 PM. Tech: React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, AWS. Tools: GitHub, Slack, Notion, Linear."
      }
    ]
  }'
```

**Expected Result**: Complete 0-9 Business Operating System structure with implementation roadmap.

### Step 4: Test GitHub Structure Creation

**Deploy the B-OS structure to GitHub:**

```bash
# Test GitHub Structure Creator
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5678/webhook/create-github-structure" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "company_name": "Tech Startup Inc",
    "github_owner": "your-github-username",
    "repository_name": "tech-startup-business-os",
    "domains": [
      {
        "number": 0,
        "name": "Foundation",
        "content": ["Vision, Mission, Values", "Legal and Governance"],
        "subdomains": [
          {"number": "0.1", "name": "Vision Mission Values"},
          {"number": "0.2", "name": "Legal Entity"}
        ]
      },
      {
        "number": 1,
        "name": "Market Intelligence",
        "content": ["Customer research", "Competitive analysis"],
        "subdomains": [
          {"number": "1.1", "name": "Customer Personas"},
          {"number": "1.2", "name": "Market Research"}
        ]
      }
    ]
  }'
```

**Expected Result**: New GitHub repository with systematic 0-9 folder structure and template files.

### Step 5: Test Daily Entropy Management

**Run manual entropy processing:**

```bash
# Test Daily Entropy Management
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5678/webhook/process-entropy" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "company_name": "Tech Startup Inc",
    "github_repos": ["tech-startup-business-os"],
    "slack_channels": ["general", "product", "strategy"]
  }'
```

**Expected Result**: Daily report with classified business information, action items, and organizational updates.
